# CommentSection Project

This is a React project built with Vite that features a dynamic `CommentSection` component. The component allows users to view, edit, and reply to comments. The project integrates with Redux for state management and supports local state manipulation for editing and replying.

## Features

- **View Comments:** Displays user comments with author names and timestamps.
- **Edit Comments:** Allows users to edit their comments inline.
- **Reply to Comments:** Users can reply to comments, and replies are displayed in a threaded manner.
- **Redux Integration:** The component dispatches actions to update the comments in the Redux store.
